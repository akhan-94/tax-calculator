## Project

This is a demo project to be used primarily for showcasing my ability to put together a simple react project. This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

This project is designed to include common tools, libraries and approaches used in building your typical web application.

## Project objectives

- Use Next.js 
  - Correct setup of app routing
  - Grouping routes
- Use React 19
- Use charting


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
